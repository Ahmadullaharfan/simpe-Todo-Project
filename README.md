# Simple Todo Project

A small practice Todo application built with React and Vite. It's a lightweight project used to learn React components, state management, and basic styling with Tailwind.

## Features

- Add, edit and remove todo items
- Mark todos as completed
- Simple search/filter for todos
- Minimal, fast development setup with Vite

## Tech stack

- React 18
- Vite (dev server + build)
- Tailwind CSS

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies

	```powershell
	npm install
	```

2. Run the dev server

	```powershell
	npm run dev
	```

3. Build for production

	```powershell
	npm run build
	```

4. Preview the production build

	```powershell
	npm run preview
	```

## Project structure

- `src/` — React components and app code
  - `componanet/` — Todo components (App-todo, TodoItem, SearchFilter, etc.)
- `public/` — static assets
- `index.html`, `vite.config.js`, `package.json`, etc.

## Notes

- This is a small practice repo; feel free to extend it (add persistence, tests, or state management libraries).
- If you want me to also add a `.gitignore` or a GitHub Actions workflow for CI, say so and I can add them.
